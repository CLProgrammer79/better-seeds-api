        "comment": "Distilled water does not have minerals, salt, .... It's pure water, so only molecule H2O. I believe that the mice that drink distilled water died because distilled water attracts (through osmosis) important minerals and other water-soluble nutrients out of the cells. In the long run, these mice die because of a lack of minerals.",
